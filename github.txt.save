And there are so many features on github for collaborators and for maintaining repos and also the projects.

forking or fork: this feature allows you to copy the repo

cloning or downloading

cloning allows you to get github files with source files. By this you can track all the previous changes and history of those source files

downloading allows you to download all the source files and make changes to it. And it doesn't contains any history or snap shots of the repository.

here to link both local and guthub repos we have to create repositories at both ends and have to be linke d by the following process.

after this you can check versions on your repo at github by using
